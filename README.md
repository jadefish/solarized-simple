# solarized-simple

A simpler Solarized theme.

## Why
I generally dislike my editor looking like confetti, so I've removed a lot of the scope colors from a Solarized TextMate theme.

## What
- Comments are a muted foreground color, exhibiting minimal contrast from the background color
- Class names and related tokens are purple
- Storage types, tags (HTML, XML), keywords, language constants, and CSS IDs are bold with no special color
- Numeric constants are teal
- Strings and regular expressions are yellow

(The colors referenced above are the original Solarized colors from http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)

Currently supports the following editors:
- Sublime Text 3
- TextMate, maybe
